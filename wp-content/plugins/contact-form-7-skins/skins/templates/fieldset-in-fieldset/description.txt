Fieldset in Fieldset provides extra structure to your form. Rather than just a simple long form, this template makes it easy for you to easily segment your form. 

For example, a form section with general contact information, could be split from a section containing your products or services. 

Included in this template are the following fields:	
- Main title
- Name
- Email (marked with a star to indicate it's required)
- Phone number
- Open message section
- Secondary title
- Checkboxes (for single or multiple selections) 
- Radio buttons (for single selection)
- Drop-down menu (for single selection)
- Fieldset within fieldset
- Submit button
- Footer text

You can copy, add, remove and alter fields, text, titles and fieldsets and more to customize the form to suit your needs.
