== Description ==

Your time-saving Swiss army knife for managing tons of featured images within minutes: Set, replace and delete them in bulk, in posts lists and set default images for future posts.

The plugin is available in English, German (Deutsch) and Catalan (Català), for the most part in Spanish (Español), Brazilian Portuguese (Português do Brasil), French (Francais), Arabic (العربية) Japanese (日本語) and Greek (Ελληνικά). It does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.

= Manage featured images quickly =

The plugin 'Quick Featured Images' helps you bulk managing featured images, setting automatic default featured images to save your time.

1. It **sets, replaces and removes featured images for hundreds of posts and pages in one go**. You can run it over all contents or let it work only to desired contents by using flexible filters.
2. It **sets, replaces and removes featured images in a sortable image column** in lists of posts, pages and custom post types if they support thumbnails. So you can change the images per post quickly without leaving the posts list page.
3. It enables you to **define presets for automatic default featured images** for future posts as many as you need. You can set **accurate rules based on post properties**.
4. It **removes database entries of featured images without existing image files** with a simple single click

If you want to include **audios, videos and custom post types** and get more options, than take a look the **Pro version** [Quick Featured Images Pro](https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=quick-featured-images&utm_content=go_pro).

See more comments under [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-featured-images/#reviews).

= Access =

1. You will find the plugin under the own **menu item 'Featured Images'** 
2. You can select an image in the media library with the **action link 'Bulk set as featured image'**. Click on it and you can go on with the plugin.
3. You can set in 'Settings' which **minimum user role is allowed to see the plugin** in his/her administration area. You can switch between 'Administrator' and 'Editor'. The default value is 'Editor'.

= Bulk Edit: Actions =

With Quick Featured Images you can apply time-saving tasks with many featured images: add, exchange and delete them in bulk.

1. **Adding featured images:** You can select an image to set it as the new featured image to hundreds of posts in one go. You can select multiple images to set them randomly as featured images.
2. **Exchanging featured images:** You can replace or update several existing featured images with a selected image in one go.
3. **Deleting featured images:** You can remove a selected featured image or all existing featured images in one go.
4. **Removing database entries of featured images without existing image files:** You can remove them and clean your database with a simple single click.

If you want to **set the first content image as featured**? Or want to **bulk set external featured images**, e.g. for a CDN? Then take a look the **Pro version** [Quick Featured Images Pro](https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme).

= Bulk Edit: Options =

Based on your selected action you can toggle on and off some options:

1. **overwrite existing featured images** or **keeping them unchanged**. The latter setting is the default.
2. **consider only posts without a featured image**. This will hide posts with featured images in the results list and will speed up the process.

If you want to use the option to **remove the first image in the content** then take a look the **Pro version** [Quick Featured Images Pro](https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme).

The **Pro version** offers you several approaches for **setting the first image as featured** additionally:

1. **the first post image** if available in the media library
2. **the first post image from the current site domain**, copy and add it to the media library if not available there
3. **the first external post image**, download it and add it to the media library
4. **the first attached image of a post**
5. **the first image of a WordPress standard gallery**
6. **the first embedded content thumbnail** (like YouTube etc.)
7. **the first image of a NextGen Gallery**.

The **Pro version** offers you two more options if you selected multiple images to set them as featured images in random order:

1. **Use each selected image only once**. If there are more posts than selected images the remaining posts will not be changed.
2. **Remove excess featured images** after all selected images are used.

If you want to use these options then take a look the **Pro version** [Quick Featured Images Pro](https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme).

= Bulk Edit: Filters =

If there would be no filters Quick Featured Images would affect all posts and pages without exception! In most cases this is not desired. 

The implemented filters allow you to narrow down the action to only the posts and pages you want to modify. The built-in filters are:

1. Filter by **post type**: Search by post types. By **default all** posts, pages and custom post types will be affected
2. Filter by **category**: Search posts by category
3. Filter by **tag**: Search posts by tag

The **Pro version** offers you additionally:

1. Filter by **format**: Search by post format
2. Filter by **author**: Search by author
3. Filter by **custom taxonomy**: Search by terms of registered taxonomies of a plugin or a theme
4. Filter by **featured image size**: Search for small featured images below a given size
5. Filter by **multimedia type**: Search for audio and video files
6. Filter by **search**: Search by search term: Search in post title and post content or in post title only
7. Filter by **status**: Search by several statuses (published, draft, private etc.). By **default all** statuses will be affected
8. Filter by **time**: Search by time specifications
9. Filter by **parent page**: Search child pages by parent page

If you want to use these filters then take a look the **Pro version** [Quick Featured Images Pro](https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme).

= Bulk Edit: Presets (Pro only) =

In the Pro version you can store all settings of a process as a preset. That is time-saving for recurring tasks managing featured images of your site.

= Automatic Default Featured Images: Rules =

**You can set rules for default featured images of posts easily.** Every time you insert a new post or save an existing post Quick Featured Images will look for a rule to add and to change the preset featured image to the saved post. 

You can define the rules based on

1. **first content image**
2. **custom taxonomy** supporting featured images
3. **post tag**
4. **post category**
5. **post author**
6. **post types**: 'Post', 'Page' and **custom post types** supporting featured images

The **Pro version** offers you additionally:

7. **multiple random images** to assign one of them to a new post
8. **external featured images**, e.g. from a CDN, to assign them automatically
9. **user defined order** of applying the types of rules
10. **first content image** if available on an external server
11. **post format** match
12. **search string in post title** match
13. **random featured images at each page load**

The rules are easy to set: choose an image, a taxonomy, a value and save the settings. That's it. **You do not need to code.**

You can add, change and delete every rule whenever you want. So you get an **precise set of rules** for automatic default featured images in your website.

After an image is removed from the library all preset rules assigned with that image will be removed automatically.

The rules take effect when a post is saved in the backend &ndash; e.g. on the post edit page &ndash; or in the frontend &ndash; e.g. via a &#8220;Create Post&#8221; form by Gravity Forms.

= Automatic Default Featured Images: Options =

You can switch between 

1. **overwriting existing featured images** or 
2. **keeping them unchanged**. 

The latter setting is the default. The option is used every time a post is saved.

= Easy managing in a sortable image column in posts lists =

Quick Featured Images adds a new column 'Featured Image' in posts lists. The additional column is sortable by the image ID. It shows the currently assigned **featured image of each post** and **action links to set, replace, edit and remove the featured image at each post**.

With that column you can get a **quick overview about all used images** and a **change featured images at every single post quickly**. You can also see posts with no featured image at a glance.

Quick Featured Images also adds a new column in the media library. It lists the titles of all posts for which the corresponding image is set as featured images. The post titles are links to the respective post edit page.

Under **'Featured Images' &gt; 'Settings'** you can switch on and off the additional columns for every single post type, even custom post types if they support thumbnails.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I set a default featured image for existing posts? =

For that use the plugin twice:

1. In 'Bulk Edit' **remove** all undesired featured images if there are some. If desired remove the images using the option 'Overwrite existing featured images'.
2. Then choose the desired image and **set** it to the posts **without the option 'Overwrite existing featured images'**. This will set the image to all posts without a featured image.

= How can I set a default featured image for future posts? =

**Or: I want image X as default featured image if the post has category Y. How to set this?**

Look at some examples:

1. To set a default featured image for every new post of the category 'Lorem ipsum':
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Category' and
	3. choose the value 'Lorem ipsum'.
	4. save the settings.
2. To set a default featured image for every new post: 
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Post Type' and
	3. choose the value 'Post'
	4. save the settings.
3. To set a default featured image for every new custom taxonomy of a theme or a plugin, e.g. events of the category 'Concert':
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Event Category' and
	3. choose the value 'Concert'.
	4. save the settings.

= Who can see Quick Featured Images in the WordPress backend? =

All users who have the right to **edit others posts** have the access to Quick Featured Images. As long as the user roles are untouched after a fresh standard WordPress installation both **Administrators** and **Editors** can use this plugin.

For these users the menu item 'Featured Images' with its sub pages appears in the WordPress backend. All other users will not see this menu item or will get an error message if they would request a Quick Featured Images page via a direct link.

= Does the plugin work in a WordPress Multisite installation? =

Yes. It works either activated for all sites (network wide) or activated in each single site. It changes only the posts of the site where you use it.

= Will I lose all the featured images if I will delete the plugin? =

No. The featured images you have already set will remain set if you deactivate or delete the plugin.

= Why does the plugin say &#8220;No matches found&#8221; after confirmation? =

This could be the case if the images were not uploaded via WordPress' own media uploader. If you have uploaded images via FTP or other ways the plugin can not find images.

It does not matter where the images are stored on your server. They can be in any folder. But they have to be uploaded via WordPress' own media uploader to be found by this plugin. If this is the case the plugin will work fine.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

If you want to contribute a translation of the plugin in your language it would be great! You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.
